A nice little program that solves Sudokus.

When running it, it first solves the one that is displayed on Sudoku's Wikipedia page and then lets you insert one manually.

Enter a number and press enter, if the cell should be empty, just press enter and move along with insertions.

After inserting, it tries to solve it. If you inserted the numbers by random or made a mistake it probably would search for the solution for ages because I havn't made a emergency escape for it.

Cheers!
